### Hey there! <img src="https://emojis.slackmojis.com/emojis/images/1536351075/4594/blob-wave.gif" width="25"/>

I’m [**Nam Lê (n4mle)**]([https://www.facebook.com/n4mle]), a developer engineer based in Viet Nam.

I design and build whatever I can imagine.

If an idea pops into my head, chances are I’ll build it and ship it.

My main tech stack is react, typescript, tailwind, and python API. My favorite tools are figma, cursor and VS code.

I’ve got a bunch of pinned projects, but my favorite is the [Profle website](https://namle-portfolio.vercel.app/).

#### Fun Facts:

* SUITS is my favorite TV series
* **Hobbies:** anime, gaming, film.
